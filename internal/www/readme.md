# CC Viewer Frontend

To start the frontend:

```
yarn dev
```

This would start site on `localhost:3000`

To start the server, from root of project:

```
go run internal/main.go
```

This runs the Go backend on a port defined by `config.go`, either read from `config.yml` or set to `2046` in the `defaults` method.

### To Test

Tests are written in the `integration` folder, and can use dummy data as request responses (ajax, fetch, axios, etc.), from the `fixtures` folder.

Open cypress:

```
yarn run cypress open
```

Serve the frontend on `localhost:8080` (_note:_ this server does not work for reloading, and is only used for testing):

```
yarn start
```

Run the tests:

```
yarn test
```

Or alternatively, `yarn autotest` combines `start` and `test`. It is used the `pre-commit` hookâ€”a script in the `.git/hooks/` folder.

### Database

The API connects to a Postgres database called `cosyl`, with username `cosyl` and password `cosyl`. These are being set in the .env file, along with the `DB_HOST`.

`DB_HOST` is the hostname of where Postgres runs. Locally, this is `localhost`. When running with Docker, it's `db` (the `name` set in `docker-compose.yml`).If running docker, in the .env file set `DB_HOST` to `db`, if running postgres locally, set to `localhost`.

If you change the username, password or db name, you need to make sure the new users and databases are created in postgres. You can manually do it with `psql` locally, and by removing the data volume of the docker image, with

```
docker-compose down --volumes
docker-compose build # this rebuilds the db image with the env user, then the volume with the env name
```
